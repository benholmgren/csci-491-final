Would you like to be a part of Nature Break?
Here are the steps to take so you can share your nature with other nature lovers

---

1. Create a Google Drive folder that contains any photos, videos, and music you would like to have on our website<br>
2. Name the Google Drive folder using the following format LastName_FirstName_Location_Date<br>
3. Share this Google Drive folder with <strong>naturebreak@naturetime.org</strong><br>
<br>
The files will be reviewed and checked for copyright issues. We ask that any material you submit belongs to you and that you have the rights to distribute it.
If you do not have audio that you would like to use with your submission we will use audio from our library.

We ask that any submission has a minimum of 1 video file or 10 high quality photos. We also ask that any music be in an mp4 file format.

In your Google Drive folder please have a text file that answers the following questions

<ul>
	<li>Location of the photos/video</li>
	<li>Date photos/video were taken</li>
	<li>Description of any landmarks or notable features</li>
</ul>
