This is the start of the discussion page

Our group decided to do a page dedicated to nature and relaxing. While this did not have the same challenges that other groups had, it did have its fair share of things to learn about. Ben, who has been super helpful, is the only one who has used Jekyll before. Because of that we have all had to learn about this new service and how it works.
